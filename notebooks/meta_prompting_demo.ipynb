The $450 million project sets aside 30% of units as affordable for households earning 60% of area median income, with construction slated to begin in Q2 2026 pending environmental review. Supporters, including the mayor and local unions, argue the plan will create 2,500 construction jobs and expand transit-oriented housing near three rail lines. Opponents, led by neighborhood groups, cite traffic, shadowing, and displacement risks, and vowed to pursue a ballot measure if mitigation is weak. The ordinance requires quarterly public reporting and a $15 million anti-displacement fund. An environmental impact study is due by March 2026; if delayed, groundbreaking could slip. Today’s vote follows two years of hearings and a compromise reducing building heights on two blocks.\n",
