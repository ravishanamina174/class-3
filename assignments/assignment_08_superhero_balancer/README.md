# Assignment 8: Superhero Power Balancer ⚡
## Combining All Prompting Techniques

### 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Master all three prompting techniques together
- Build complex multi-stage analysis systems
- Choose optimal techniques for each subtask
- Create balanced game mechanics using AI

### 📚 Scenario
"MetaVerse Gaming" is creating a superhero battle game but struggles with power balancing. You must build an AI system that analyzes superhero abilities, calculates power levels, detects game-breaking combinations, and suggests nerfs/buffs. Each analysis task requires different prompting approaches.

### 🔧 Your Task
Build a `PowerBalancer` class that:
1. Analyzes hero abilities (zero-shot for novel powers)
2. Classifies power types (few-shot pattern matching)
3. Calculates interactions (CoT for complex logic)
4. Detects overpowered combinations (combined approach)
5. Suggests balance changes (all techniques)

### 📝 Requirements
- Use zero-shot for creative power analysis
- Apply few-shot for power categorization
- Implement CoT for interaction calculations
- Combine all methods for comprehensive balancing
- Generate detailed balance reports

### 🎮 Challenges
1. **Basic**: Analyze individual hero powers
2. **Intermediate**: Calculate team synergies
3. **Advanced**: Detect meta-breaking combinations
4. **Bonus**: Create auto-balancing system

### 🚀 Getting Started
1. Set up your OpenAI API key
2. Install packages: `pip install langchain-openai langchain-core`
3. Complete the TODO sections in `power_balancer.py`
4. Test with provided superhero rosters
5. Create the perfectly balanced hero team!
