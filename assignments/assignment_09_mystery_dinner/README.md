### 📚 Scenario
You're creating an AI detective for murder mystery dinner parties. The AI must analyze character backgrounds, alibis, clues, and motives to solve the mystery. Each aspect requires different prompting approaches: zero-shot for psychological profiling, few-shot for clue patterns, and CoT for deductive reasoning.

2. Identifies clue patterns (few-shot matching)
3. Traces alibis (CoT timeline reasoning)
4. Connects evidence (combined approach)
5. Solves the mystery with confidence scores

### 🚀 Getting Started
1. Set up your OpenAI API key
2. Install packages: `pip install langchain-openai langchain-core`
3. Complete the TODO sections in `mystery_solver.py`
4. Test with provided murder mystery scenarios
5. Unmask the killer!
