# Assignment 6: Alien Language Translator 👽
## Few-Shot + Chain of Thought for Language Decoding

### 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Combine few-shot examples with step-by-step reasoning
- Build pattern recognition with logical deduction
- Create linguistic analysis systems
- Handle ambiguous communication patterns

### 📚 Scenario
First contact! Earth has received messages from an alien civilization. You must build an AI translator that learns from example translations and uses logical reasoning to decode new messages. The aliens communicate using symbols, sounds, and mathematical patterns that require both pattern matching and deductive reasoning.

### 🔧 Your Task
Build an `AlienTranslator` class that:
1. Learns from example alien-to-human translations
2. Uses reasoning to identify linguistic patterns
3. Decodes new messages step-by-step
4. Identifies cultural concepts and context
5. Handles ambiguous or partial translations

### 📝 Requirements
- Use few-shot for pattern learning
- Apply CoT for decoding logic
- Handle multiple alien languages
- Provide confidence scores for translations
- Explain translation reasoning

### 🚀 Getting Started
1. Set up your OpenAI API key
2. Install packages: `pip install langchain-openai langchain-core`
3. Complete the TODO sections in `alien_translator.py`
4. Test with provided alien messages
5. Decode the secret intergalactic treaty!
